# Government Debt Data from the original source, OEDC
The first chart that I would like to show is the bar chart

## Government Debt Data Chart 1
Here I visualize the Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country from the year 1995 - 2021. I use the gray color and background so we can see the line graph of each country better.

## Government Debt Data chart 2
In the design, I decide to use tree map, highlighting the country that has the highest debt which is Greece.

## Government Debt Data chart 3
I then scope only Europe region so the comparative context is reasonable and concrete. Now you can see that Greece financial debt leaned toward bankruptcy, which threatened to set off a new financial crisis in the Europe.
