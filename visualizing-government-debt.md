# Government Debt Data from the original source, OEDC
The first chart that I would like to show is the bar chart compared across countries.

## Government Debt Data Chart 1
I visualize the Debt-to-GDP ratio for each country from the year 1995 - 2019. You can see the general government debt trends are varied across the world. Here, I use the gray color and background so we can see the line graph of each country better.

## Government Debt Data chart 2
In the design, I decide to use tree map, highlighting the country that has the highest debt which is Greece. The treemap allow us to see the proportion of government debt at the particular point of time (2019). I also add the filter for the users to see the details of particular country that the users interested.

## Government Debt Data chart 3
I then scope only Europe region so the comparative context is reasonable and concrete. Now you can see that Greece financial debt leaned toward bankruptcy, which threatened to set off a new financial crisis in the Europe.
