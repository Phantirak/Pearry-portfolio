# Outline

Project summary 
“Despite being a world-renowned tourist destination, Thailand remains trapped in the middle-income country.”

Thailand is a top destination for tourists, attracting millions of visitors each year with its rich culture, stunning beaches, and unique attractions. According to the World Tourism Organization, Thailand was ranked as the 5th most popular tourist destination, with approximately 40 million international tourist arrivals in 2019.  Despite its popularity, the country remains trapped in the middle-income bracket, unable to fully capitalize on its tourism potential. These challenges limit Thailand's ability to move up the economic ladder and achieve higher levels of economic development. 

As my background is in a financial government agency, my target readers in this project are policy makers, Central Bank. And I think they would like to see the supporting data analysis in visualizations that are easy to understand, digest and grasp the important concept that potentially leads to policy actions i.e. propose the policy formulation to the Bank of Thailand Committee and related agencies e.g. Department of Labor that could, in the end, effectively unlock Thailand's potential and transcend its middle-income trap.


## Initial sketches

Project Structure
In my project structure, I will divide my storytelling into three phases as below:
 
1. Introduction:
-	I would first kick off by presenting the fact about Thailand’s top tourist destination country in the world and how it contributes to the substantial increase in Thailand’s economic growth and create jobs across the country in high level.

2. Data analysis and example:
-	I will then demonstrate the fact that despite the prosperity of the tourist industry, the country faces numerous challenges that prevent it from reaching higher levels of economic development. In this particular part, it will rely heavily on economic factors visualizations such as GDP and income ratio. 
-	The key idea of data analysis here is trying to tackle the reasons behind Thailand's ongoing struggles in economic development. I will combine both the fact quote (for example, quote from World Bank) and the statistical information to take readers to a closer look at the problem. Thus, having concrete and clear visualization in this stage is very important.

3. Proposed solutions and call to action:
-	In this phase, I will talk about solutions that we can do as policy makers to get Thailand out of this middle-income trap. 
-	I plan to have two solutions, dividing into short-term and long-term plans. For each solution, I will highlight the advantage and their constraints or limitations. 
-	For the call to action, I hope that these solutions will be proposed to the executive committee in the Central Bank of Thailand and related agencies for the policy formulation which, in the end, lead to my ultimate goal of unlocking Thailand's potential and uplifts its middle-income trap.

## Sketches
For the introduction, I plan to utilize tourism quotes and visuals to showcase Thailand as a land of paradise. The quote and picture that I find quite impressive and potentially put in my project is shown as below. 

![Picture11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67538479/222624355-8a992b44-fc07-4fe1-ab46-8c32205f91a9.png)

I will then use world map or bar chart to highlight Thailand’s world top tourist destination ranking compared across the world. Notice that I will present the data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic such that it would not deteriorate the analysis by such outlier factors. 

I first try the world map vistualization as below, to convey the message that comparing with global travel and tourism, Thailand is the most top 10 popular tourist destination countries. I plan to use the technique of shading blue color to demonstrate the degrees of positivity i.e., the number of international tourisms so it will convey a more logical order. Thus, the darker blue reflects the higher volumn of international tourist arrivals. I intentionally choose blue as the color scheme because blue is often viewed as a fairly standard and traditional symbolic color for reliability. 
 
As you can see as above, our country is relatively small compared to other countries, thus, it does not highlight my key message enough. As a result, I change to bar chart. The visualization seems better. It clearly demonstrates that Thailand is within top 10 tourist world destinations list and ranking on 5th according to World Tourism Organization’s record.

Then my story is now starting to link to the economic perspective by saying that such the popularity leads to the high number of employments in Tourism Industry and high rate of tourist expenditure compared across the world.

Next step, I will begin to scope down to Thai’s economic perspective by having the correlation graph. Here, I would like to visualize the relationship that greaters number of tourists have the positive relationship with Thai GDP per capita. I choose this graph because I think it’s a chart type that most people are familier with and easy to understand the correlations i.e. positive or negative relationship. In addition, as I mentioned earlity that my target audiences are policy makers, I assume that they will understand that correlation does not imply causation.

Now, I will emphasize on the fact that despite the prosperity of the tourist industry, Thai people is still struggling in the middle-income trap for more than 10 years. I decided to quote the fact from “World Bank” research on Thailand Economic Overview,2022 to get the attention from the audiences. I made this quote in powerpoint and save it as a picture. I highlight the key message here which is the “middle-income” economy and its related number in bold and bigger font size to catch audiences’ attention and stimulate humans’ recognition.

I will then take the audience throught the economic variables as the data-driven evidence based. I look into the several variables/factors that has the potential best presented my story here. I did some research and I think that the best respresentative of economic factors that generally understand across audiences are household median income and the GDP per capital. I decide to use line chart to compare the trend over time. My main message here is that even though the GDP is increasing over time, the household median income is stagnant since 1995! Meaning that our economic is not growing as well as household living standards are not rising, instead, stucking in the middle-income bracket.

After that, I will take the audience into the several factors that contribute to such middle-income trap status. I intentionally highlight the first factor in “gray” background color. This is because the first factor is critical and it’s under the responsibility of Central Bank which is my main audience.

For the solution proposal part, I plan to have the short-term and long-term solution. The headlines are in navy blue and the description/details are in gray box. For each solution, I will highlight the advantage and its challenges as well.


# The data
The data I used in my project is all from the public data sources. Thus, it is highly reliable, transparent, and easily access. I devide my data into three categories:

**1.	The tourism data**
This data is mainly from the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). It is the United Nations public agency responsible for promoting tourism as a tool for economic development, job creation, and poverty reduction. UNWTO plays an important role in shaping the future of global tourism and encouraging international cooperation in tourism, thus , the data provided from its website is not only the volume of inbound tourism but also includes economic perspectives/indicators such as GDP and employment in tourism industries across countries. In addition, the website also have the dashboard for monitoring the tourism movement/status for different countries around the world. Thus, it’s very useful for me when I have to choose the countries that I would like to compared with. As a result, it reduces size and time for
download dataset.

Dashboard https://www.unwto.org/tourism-data/global-and-regional-tourism-performance 
Data set https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/tourism-statistics-database 
Indicators https://www.unwto.org/tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics 

**2.	The global economic data**
My primary source of economic data is from World Bank website. The World Bank is a leading provider of data on global development covering a wide range of topics, including economics. The most advantage of using world bank data is that it provides the comparable economic variables across different countries in a comprehensive format. Thus, its useful for my macroeconomic analysis for example, compared Thai GDP or Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) with other top tier countries in tourism industries or compared Thai economic with the countries in the same region. My primary dataset is under the World Development Indicators (WDI) and Global Economic Monitor (GEM).

Data set: 
https://databank.worldbank.org/home.aspx  and https://databank.worldbank.org/databases 
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.KLT.DINV.WD.GD.ZS?end=2021&locations=TH&start=1970&type=shaded&view=chart

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=TH 

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN?locations=TH 

**3.	Thai Government Open Data**

This datasource is provided by Thai government aiming to make government data accessible and available to the public. This website includes data from various government agencies and departments such as statistics, demographic information, economic indicators, and others. I will use this data to create visualizations that have the content specifically in Thai context such as data analysis in Thai labor force, wage rate and number of SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) etc. In addition, I plan to use the statistic report from this source to support my proposed solution as well.

Data set: https://data.go.th/en/dataset?q=%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%97%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A7&sort=score+desc%2C+metadata_modified+desc 


# Method and medium

I will be using Shorthand as a flatform to showcase my project which would also be the main program used during my presentation. From what I saw Shorthand examples in class, I think Shorthand allow audiences to quickly capture information in a concise and organized manner. Moreover, Shortland does not come in a traditional powerpoint slides format, thus, it might get more attention from the audiences.

In addition, I plan to use Flourish and Tabeau to create data vistualizations/graphs to support my storytelling. I believe that by embedding such vistualizations into Shorthard, it will make my presentation more robust and looks more professional. Since my audiences are policy makers, having the clear and convincing vistualizations are very important. This is because we are expecting the policy action as a consequence from the presentation and such policy actions impact many people’s lives.

In class critique:
-	The ranking visualization is very clear and easy to compare with difference countries.
-	My topic is very complex and target audiences is very specific, thus, trying to add more subtitle or description in graphs when it comes to the building vistualization stages.
-	Explain the “Middle Income Trap” to the audiences when perform the presentation.
