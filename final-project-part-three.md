# The final data story
From final project part I where I developed the outline and draft my sketch to part II where I started to take the reader through my story wireframes and seek for feedback, now we reach the final part of the story! In this project part III, I will take you through all the revision and decision I have made to reach my final version. And here is the link to my final story **“Middle-Income Trap, Thailand”!**

# Changes made since Part II
In this final project part III, I cooperate the feedback from user researches and from professor to improve my story. I have grouped my adjustments into four difference topics below.

**1. The graph vistualization**
I have received positive feedback about my visualization choices. However, there are comments about the the title & subtitle, the position, size, and color. I first prioritize changing the title and subtitle so that audiences can just easily understand the story through the visuals without having read the analysis content. Then I try to reorganize the position and size so that the graph can be easily seen, not buried with description and the analysis. Lastly, I make sure that the position is alignment with the text analysis/content at the eye level. I also revisit some colors but it’s minority because most of my visualization, I’m using teal to signify Thailand and others are grey. 

**2. The images & quotation**
My first revision on the image is to change the pictures at the opening page (the title page). Initially, I have the image of beautiful Thai temples and some of my interviewees thought that my topic is about promoting Thailand’s tourism. Hence, I decided to change the image to Bangkok city where you can see the disparity Thai people’s living standard (condominiums contrasing with the slums) so it can reflect the economic problem better. The second improvement about images is to add the references. I revise all of my images and make sure that they come from copyright-free sources e.g. Unsplash.com

For the quote part, I have removed the header/title of the quote e.g. “Macro Economic Perspective”, suggested by professor since the quote has already reflects the title by itself unlike graph/chart that you need title for clarification. I also work on putting the reference/source of the quote as well.

**3. The story transition**
I put more connecting section and narrative walkthrough the story step by step to make sure that the audience will not get lost will all the graphs and information and they are clear with my key messages in each section. Here, I also use technique “bold the text” for the important messages and highlighting the key takeaway. According to the feedback specifically on the call-to-action transition, I use more actionable words such as “Policy Recommendation for Thai Government Agencies” instead of just explicitly say “Call to action”. 

**4. The content**
My priority is to work on the call-to-action part. Instead of only having a click that directy link people to the research paper, I try to add the data visualization, specifically on R&D comparison bar graph and human development line graph, and detailed analysis that support my policy recommendation so that my call to action is solid and concrete enough to persuade the policy makers. In addition, the feedback I received in part II also mentioned about there are some duplicate in the Central Bank's monetary policy section with the previous sections on “key factors to overcome the middle-income trap”. So, I streamline and condense the story and put them under “Innovation Financing Policy” of my policy recommendation section. I also eliminate the “Improving Infrastructure” in the recommendation since it currently does not support by presented graphs and focus more on “Innovation Financing Policy” and “Reform the labor market” part. 

As one of my interviewees comment about the confusion between middle income trap and inequality income, I then work on revision of the wording used in the analysis to make sure it focuses on the middle-income issue and not leading to inequality in income. In addition, I need to add disclaimers about the economic context of each country when making the comparison between countries as suggested feedback. Lastly, I add some description/subtitle for technical words and illustrate more on the surrounding/consequence context. For example, after I tell the audience that Thailand is in the middle-income trap, I will then them what is the definition of it and why it’s negatively impact Thai economy. And to make sure that the content is clear and not too text heavy, I split the sentences to the bullet point.
