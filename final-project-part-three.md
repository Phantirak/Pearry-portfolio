# The final data story
From final project part I where I developed the outline and draft my sketch to part II where I started to take the reader through my story wireframes and seek for feedback, now we reach the final part of the story! In this project part III, I will take you through all the revision and decision I have made to reach my final version. And here is the link to my final story “Middle-Income Trap, Thailand”!
