# Overview: 
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important economic indicator because it measures the overall price level of goods and services of a particular country. CPI is commonly used as a proxy for the general rate of inflation, and they are used by governments and financial regulators to set inflation targets for purpose of monetary policy. As a central banker at the Bank of Thailand, I know that the CPI plays a crucial role in the macroeconomic analysis in order to obtain an understanding of the inflation of the country. Thus, having the right visualization of CPI will support policymakers in determining the appropriate monetary policy such as setting interest and controlling inflation with the goal to maintaining price stability of the country. As a result, I decided to recreate the visualization from the IMF website which initially means to make the comparison of the CPI index among different countries over time. My goal is to reveal a hidden pattern or gain insightful economic information by comparing Thailand with other financial leading countries and provide policy recommendation/ insightful information to the financial supervision committee, Bank of Thailand.

## Overall Process:
The redesigned process will break into 5 steps starting from finding a data visualization and understanding the intention of the visualization. The second step is to make the self-critique i.e. disassembling the aspects of the data visualization and identifying what is the potential solution/recommendation that could make such visualization more effectively reach out to the target audience. Then we will start to sketch out a proposed solution in step three and share to three different people, including performing in-class critiques to test the solution and asking for feedback in step four. Lastly, I will modify my design based on those feedbacks and then come up with a final solution!

## Step 1 Find A Visualization & Its Associated Data
Original visualization

The visualization that I am critiquing is from the IMF website. It is aiming to show the cross-country comparison, year over year, of the CPI index. The country will be chosen from the list provided. The default values are including the leading financial countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, etc. In this case, I intended to select Thailand as the main country that I would like to perform the comparison. The data source used here is from the coordination between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Cooperations and Development (OECD). Countries are reporting at the aggregate level through the portal provided by IMF.

Data source: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD 
https://data.imf.org/?sk=4FFB52B2-3653-409A-B471-D47B46D904B5&sId=1485878855236 


## Step 2 Critique the Visualization

Usefulness (5/10) :

I think the comparison is valuable in terms of the audiences being able to see the overall trend of the CPI growth rate movement is positively increasing across time at one glance. However, the visualization does not provide the meaning behind each movement and the number of CPI indexes which are very crucial to the regulators in the financial industry in order to make monetary policy decisions. For example, we only know it’s increasing but by how much in specific? Are such movements signifying something important from the economic perspective? Are there any warning signs or anomalies that the audience should notice from the chart? There is no such information communicated here.

Completeness (6/10) :

I think the visualization does not include sufficient information, not only specify the number of CPI each year of each country but also the reference line for the comparison. To illustrate, in order to make the judgment on how each country performs on economic development, context information such as comparisons to the global average index should be given. I also notice that Y-axis does not fully label the unit. Thus it can be ambiguous for the audience whether it’s a ratio or a percentage.

Perceptibility (3/10) :

The visualization and colors are not displayed in a manner that the human eye and brain can perceive with minimal effort. The number of lines makes it quite hard for the audience to keep track of the information across time series. They would not know which line they should focus on. In addition, the colors are too colorful and confusing, making it unclear on the key message trying to convey and difficult to extract the story or the pattern behind the historical data.

Truthfulness (7/10) :

Because the data comes from the official website with high credibility at the international level, the data for visualization used here is accurate and valid. Thus, the graph is quite reliable. But I deduct three points here, as the Y-axis should be more explicitly labeled about the units used and the small scale makes it hardly see the negative index for some countries in a particular year. As a result, the audience might misunderstand and misinterpret the information if they do not notice such differences.

Intuitiveness (7/10) :

The line graph format is familiar for time series data and easily understood by general audiences. Its simple instructions enable its usage with relatively little learning. To illustrate, the line graph starting from the beginning of the data point goes along the way with a timeline from left to right and movement up and down indicating the growth of the index is quite intuitive. Regardless, putting too many lines can make it difficult to understand.

Aesthetic (3/10):

The colors of the graph are very colorful, thus instead of catching the audience’s interest, they create confusion for the audience. The colors are all fighting for attention such that, the audience might not know where to focus or look at first. The Y-axis does not provide the background grid line, as a result, the further from the Y-axis the harder to correctly identify the index in a particular year. Adding the grid line and labels in the revision would help the audience to determine the magnitude or the degree of the index better. The title color is also too light almost fade as they use light grey color. It does not catch the audience’s attention as much as it supposed to be.

Engagement (3/10):

I think that the visualization allows the general audience to understand the topic displayed in a shallow way i.e., only the CPI index trend. However, for a specific group of the audience e.g. those who are specialists working in the monetary market, the data visualization presented is not efficient enough to share or make the implication of the CPI comparison at the first glance.

Question 1: Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn’t? What, if anything, would you do differently?

What stood out to me is the trend of time series of every country at one glance. Since the objective of this visualization is comparison, it uses line graph to illustrate the time series of historical data quite well. However, the colors presented are very varied and colorful. Thus, making the visualization looks confusing to the audience. They do not know where to look at since the colors are everywhere. If I were IMF, the owner of this visualization, I would use the dominant colors for the country that I'm interested, show other countries in lighter colors for example, gray. This way a single point of interested will come up and makes audiences understand the key message without even putting any description.

Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not? *

The primary audiences would be financial regulators, policy makers, and economic analysts. I think this visualization is partially informative and not much effective if we use this visualization to demonstrate it to the audiences. This is because the graph does not clearly convey a key message (meaning behind those CPI movements), does not label any number (which is quite important for our primary audience in the practical field), or provides any average number that could be used as the benchmark for comparison. In addition, it does not emphasize where I should start to look since the colors are everywhere fighting for attention. For me, recoloring is the priority to make improvements to this chart. Not only it will make the chart looks clearer but it also highlights the country in which the audiences might be interested.

Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *

This method makes me think deeper about what I should revise to this chart. I feel like there are many potential transformations and information added to this graph. I might consider changing the type of graph to a stacked bar while using line reference for benchmarking i.e. average CPI index line, adding the label in the line at eye level as well as the number of CPI indexes in the most recent period since numbers are quite important to the regulators and analysts for their future usage in reports or policy formulation. In addition, I would definitely change the color palette to make visualization clearer. Since my intention is to make a comparison between my country, Thailand’s CPI index to other financial leader countries, I would highlight Thailand in one different color such as orange, and others in gray. I will add the title to be more informative about the main idea rather than just a description of the data structure. 

## Step 3: Wireframe a Solution

The key factors from the critique that informed my re-design process/wireframing process were:

1.	Enabling the comparison of the main interested country i.e. Thailand with other leading financial countries in one graph
2.	Transforming the line graph to a stacked bar to reduce the confusion over many lines presented.
3.	Reassigned the color by highlighting Thailand in one different color such as orange and others in gray.
4.	Adding the number of CPI index in the most recent year (adding every year might be too much)
5.	Add the reference line for comparison i.e. the average CPI 
6.	Add the title, stating the main idea extracted from the chart

For the second draft version, I make some changes to the title format by splitting it into two lines. I also put the number for the line of the average CPI index so that the audience can use that number for reference each year. Lastly, I rename the country to be in the abbreviation version as well as resized the bar, so it looks more organized and cleaner with additional space between each bar.

## Step 4: Test the Solution

For this section, I will ask three people for feedback about the sketches above.

The first person, a student late 20’s

•	She understands that the graph shows the CPI index for each country and compares the trend between them but does not certain what the line is for. She assumes that the moving trend line might be for Thailand or the average CPI index.
•	She thinks that the intended audience is the Finance department in Thailand.
•	The number of countries comparison is quite overwhelming. The chart might not need all those countries. She suggests trying to be more specific in selecting which country to compare with. In addition, it seems that all countries also have spiked CPI, not only Thailand in 2020. 
•	It’s a little bit hard to read the label for 2022 and delete the x-axis for 2012 and 2023 if does not have data.

The second person, a student late 20’s

•	The visualization displays a trend in data. Initially, based on the title, he assumed this was a particular data trend regarding Thailand and it seems to be a comparison of the CPI of various countries.
•	The audience may be people who are concerned about the Thai or international economy in general.
•	He finds that the title and context of the visualization present a high likelihood of being misleading and therefore, confusing. The title appears to suggest that the content pertains to Thailand, however, upon examining the bar graph and legend, it seems that the primary purpose is to compare the CPI of multiple countries. Additionally, there is a line present in the visualization that he is unable to comprehend its meaning or the data it represents among the various information presented. 
•	He comments that the title or subtitle could be easily revised to accurately reflect the content and avoid giving the impression that the visualization pertains solely to Thailand. The revised title or subtitle should accurately convey that the content is a comparison of various countries with a focus on Thailand. Additionally, he suggests a more clear legend for the line present between the bar charts be provided. If deemed unnecessary, the lines may be considered for removal.
•	Remove the X-axis for 2012 and 2023 since it does not have data.

The third person, a student late 20’s

•	The graph shows the CPI movement across time, focusing on Thailand. 
•	The audience might be an economic specialist.
•	She thinks that the title is not clear and would like to add more subtitles explaining the meaning of the CPI index.
•	She likes how I use color to distinguish Thailand from other countries. However, she suggests that I should put a number label on the bar. In addition, I should put the countries’ legends only once, either on the bar or in a separate box. Reducing the number of countries is also a good option to make the graph clearer and consider changing from an abbreviation name to a full name so the audience can easily understand at glance. 
•	For the line, use Thailand’s CPI instead of the overall CPI average since the context is about Thailand. Moreover, remove the number from the line and use the same color as signified Thailand in the stacked bar.
•	Remove the X-axis for 2012 and 2023 if does not have data and add unit measured in Y-axis
In-class critique
•	Because of the color, the graph makes it stands out that it is the CPI movement of Thailand compared with other countries across time.
•	They suggest using the trend line of Thailand’s CPI movement instead of the global average since the target audience is specific in the Thai financial landscape.
•	Some audiences might not know what is CPI, should add a subtitle explaining the meaning and implications
•	Revise the comparison countries, remove some countries that are not relevant to the Thai context or policy maker’s decision for example, removes “Germany and add “China” instead
•	Can add the time event for the COVID-19 pandemic surge in 2020 so that the audience will understand immediately why the CPI increased during that period.


The similarities that emerged were:
1.	All of those who examined my visualization were very quickly able to determine what was being displayed and who is the intended audience. The color used allowed them to understand which country I would like to make a comparison with. As a result, my design appeared to be clear to those I shared my design with.
2.	Revise the line presented in a graph, be more clear whether it indicates the world average CPI index or Thailand’s CPI index.
3.	Remove the X-axis for 2012 and 2023 since it does not have data.
4.	Revise the legend of the countries and reduce the number of countries being compared, considering the financial implication and the target audience.
5.	Revise the title and add the subtitle, explaining the CPI meaning and its implications.
The difference that emerged was:
1.	Add a unit for Y-axis.
2.	Put the number in the stacked bar.
3.	Change the country labels from abbreviation to full name because it’s easier to understand.
4.	Adding the unusual event that occurred in 2020, so the audience understands the spikes of inflation.
5.	Add the time event for the COVID-19 pandemic surge in 2020.

## Step five: Build your solution.

Based on the feedback from previous step, I come up with the final design changes below:
My first priority is to alter the reference line. I like the class critique of having Thailand’s CPI movement line instead of the global average because I think it’s useful when central bankers are making the policy formulation, they are focusing on Thailand’s current economic movement. I then revise the axis to be more precise and accurate as well as removed the irrelevant label. 

I reduce the comparison countries. Scoping only the top 4 leading financial countries U.S., U.K., Japan, and adding “China”. If includes Thailand, 5 countries in one stack bar are considered to be the optimal number, not too less and not too many that confused the audience like the initial draft version. I will put the label separately in a box so the graph would look clean and organized.
Lastly, I will revise the title and add the subtitle according to the feedback.
Here is my final version!

## Reflection:

The most difficult part of creating this final visualization is to create the “dual axis” so that the reference line is using the same scale as the stacked bar, otherwise, the line presented would be off and might mislead in interpretation. I intentionally use “orange” to signify Thailand’s line trend movement. This is because the audience can intuitively understand right away that the line represents Thailand’s CPI movement, not the global average. 

I then started to work on X and Y axis revision. I removed 2012 and 2023 as they do not have data. I also repetitively rescale X and Y axis and bar sizes many times so the graph looks well organized, not overwhelming, and not confused the audience especially when the feedback suggested putting numbers into the bar graph. I have been thinking about trading off between putting details (numbers) and having a cleaner graph. I later decide to put numbers in because our target audiences are expertise who generally works closely with numbers, rather than just looking at the overall trend. In addition, in order to make any monetary policy recommendation or call for action, the supporting evidence is often driven by numbers.

Thank you for spending the time going through all the processes with me and I hope you like my revision!
