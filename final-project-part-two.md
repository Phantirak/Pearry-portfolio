# Wireframes / storyboards
From the outline and the first sketches of the project in part 1, I will now start to build on the wireframe. I will be using Shorthand as a primary platform to create a wireframe such that when I perform the user research interview, it would be easier for them to understand the story flow and the message I try to convey. My storyboard layout will start with an introduction, data analysis and example, then a solution proposal and call to action. Here, I incorporate the feedback that I got from the professor and in-class critique to refine my outline as well as revise some data visualization to better reflect the story and create more concrete data-driven evidence for the call-to-action section. 
For the data visualization part, I mainly use “Flourish” to create charts/graphs to support my statement/context and embed such visualizations into Shorthard to complete my storytelling. One nice thing about Flourish is that it has motion features on the graph such as a racing line chart which makes my presentation more robust and persuasive to the audience. 
I believe that the combination of shorthand and Flourish features will provide my target interviewees with a high-fidelity impression and easy-to-follow, yet impactful for the call to action which is the key element of the story. Here is my storyboard!

Noticing here that for the final project part 2, my work is still working in progress. Some analyses might not be in-depth/concise enough, and I might revise some charts to make the story clearer to the audience. But you will be able to see the skeleton of the story and the critical key elements as well as visualization in Shorthand. After the in-class critique and feedback that I will receive after conducting the user research, the content and the visualization will revise and finalized in project part 3.


# User research 

## Target audience
My story is focusing on tackling an economic issue perspective, specifically on the “Middle-Income Trap” of my country. Hence, my target audiences would be financial regulators i.e. Central Bank and Ministry of Finance, policymakers, and related government agencies such as The Ministry of Digital Economy and Society in Thailand. 

Since my target audience is quite specific and needs some background expertise, my approach to identifying the interview representative is, first, they need to have an economic or public policy background. This is because the content is quite related to the usage of index/variables that describe Thailand’s economic situation. Even though I have put the subtitle to explain the index’s meaning, it might still be quite complicated and hard to comprehend for the general audience. 

Second, I would like to interview individuals who have some working experience, especially in government agencies. This is because my target audiences are mainly middle to high executives of the country who have the authority and power to make/call for policy action. Hence, having feedback from those who have been working with professional standards would be very valuable to my story and visualizations improvement.

Third, to ensure that my final project is intuitive and understandable to all, my target interviewees also include those who have varying levels of background in data analytics and visualization. 

Forth, as optional, I would like to interview those who are from the East Asia region. This is because they will understand the background and context of why I selected the specific country to compare with Thailand. For example, I would pick Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia to compare the GDP per capita in order to illustrate the depreciation of Thailand’s competitiveness since those countries are considered the same tier of developing nations in the region.
I identified four interviewees for the user research, with the following characteristics:

Interview 1: Female senior central banker (35), Thailand

Her background education is a bachelor’s degree in Economics and a master’s in public policy. She has extensive working experience in the Central Bank of Thailand for more than six years. She is an expert in banking supervision and monetary policy formulation area. She also has a background in using data to communicate with stakeholders which are mainly financial institutions and executives in the central bank.

Interview 2: Female policy-data analytics pathway student and former employee in the Office of Insurance Commission (29), Thailand

Prior to her master’s degree, she had some working experience in a government agency in Thailand and mainly used data for communication and policy formulation. Currently, she is studying data analytics and took the “Telling Story with Data” course before.

Interview 3: Male policy-data analytics pathway student and former employee in the Ministry of Finance (28), Japan

He completed his undergraduate studies in Economics. He had extensive working experience of more than five years in the financial and economic field. Currently, he is studying data analytics, specializing in Advanced Machine Learning.

Interview 4: Male policy student and former employee in the Ministry of Finance (30), Indonesia

He has extensive working experience in both economics and the public policy field. Currently, he is studying public policy and took some courses related to data analytics and visualization.

## Interview script
The primary goal that I would like to get from the interview includes four topics: the aesthetic, the story’s comprehensive and logical coherence, the persuasive effectiveness for call-to-action, and the additional feedback so that I could get specific improvement on my story. I break down each goal into interview questions listed below:


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   1.	The aesthetic and attraction   | 	What are your initial reactions at the first glance?                |
|  2.	The comprehensive story flow and the logical coherence | Overall, do the flow of the story and data clear and make sense? What is the main message that the story is trying to convey?|
|3.	The persuasive effectiveness|  Are you able to identify who is the target audience? Does the visualization support the storytelling and is compelling enough for “call-to-action”? |
   |4.	The feedback for improvement        |	Are there any specific parts that you find it’s confusing and would like to change or add?|


## Interview findings
Overall, I got positive feedback on the visualizations and the coherence of the storytelling as charts and pictures complement the context and the transitions are quite smooth. In addition, the target audience is very clear to them. Regardless, it requires additional work in the detail of the graph title/subtitle and economic analysis.
Please see the detail of the interviewees’ responses to each question in the table below:

**Question1**

What are your initial reactions at the first glance?

Interview 1
At first glance, I thought it was a topic about promoting Thailand’s tourism due to the images and visualization. After I saw the topic title then I realized it’s about economics. She has done a very good job on visualization and the content is easy to read. Make me want to continue going through the story.

Interview 2
At first glance, I see that the topic will talk about Thailand, and portray Thailand as a tourist attraction country (with the photo of the sea and temples)

Interview 3
Nice story webpage. Great graphics and visualization.

Interview 4
Impressed with the very nice design of graphics and visualization

**Question2**
Overall, do the flow of the story and data clear and make sense? What is the main message that the story is trying to convey

Interview 1
Yes, clear message and the flow is logical coherence.
The key idea conveyed in the message is to provide an overview of the Thai economy and highlight the issue of middle-income traps. This is achieved through a comprehensive analysis of numerical data across multiple dimensions, along with a comparative assessment with other countries.

Interview 2
Yes, charts/pictures complement the context and the transitions are smooth.
The main message based on the topic is that Thailand has to do something so that it is not trapped here, despite it being a tourist destination which one might assume generate lots of money inflow

Interview 3
Overall, the data makes sense, only some parts of the story are not quite straightforward.
The story is about the middle-income trap in Thailand and how to overcome it.

Interview 4
Regarding the related stories, the overall structure is coherent, except for the transition to the call-to-action section, which is unclear to me. It would be better to present the call-to-action using a simple sentence like "Reform something!" or "Provide something for something", followed by an explanation, so that the target audience can clearly understand what action to take.
The main message is saying that regardless of Thailand’s popularity in tourism, Thai people are stuck in the middle-income trap.

**Question3**

Are you able to identify who is the target audience?
Does the visualization support the context of storytelling and is compelling enough for “call-to-action”? 

Interview 1
Adding the title and subtitle can help clarify the understanding of the graph
In terms of content, you might need to add the disclaimer that the industrial background between Thai and South Korea is different from the past. Looking forward, Thailand’s heading towards a more innovative and knowledge-based economy under the "New S-Curve" strategy. And such that we expect more R&D expenditures in the future trend.

Interview 2
In the first pie chart – Is there any intention to highlight agriculture - a bit eye-catching from the rest grey parts?
I feel that the background context is quite long until you reach your key point of tackling the income trap - that is only like in the last couple of slides. 
I can definitely say that she spent a huge amount of time doing this. I would just maybe more emphasize the call to action, as there are lots of background stories but not much on call for action. But overall, I really like it.

Interview 3
I am not sure about mentioning tourism in the first half, I think you should emphasize the message here.
I was not sure how income inequality is related to the middle-income trap which sounds similar to GDP growth. Also, income inequality was not clearly mentioned in the section on the key factors to overcome the middle-income trap.

Interview 4
Are there any good visuals to support your claim that improving infrastructure is one of the key factors to overcoming the middle-income trap? 
I would add some visuals to support the statement or else focusing only on financial and upskilling labor are good enough.

## In class critique
-	The graphs and visualizations are beautiful and easy to understand. They really like the line racing chart when compare between countries, it suits my story and analysis well.
-	My story is able to comprehend regardless of the complexity of the context and the background of the audience.
-	They are able to understand the key message of the story. But they have some comments on the text-heavy analysis. It would be better if I could break down them into bullet points or bold the key takeaways statement. 
-	For the graph, try to add the subheading and organize the tickmarks.
-	The call-to-action is very clear and specific to the target audience. The concern is that I need to figure out a way to present the story that will resonate with the in-class audience.


## Identified changes for Part III
# Final thoughts and future updates
For the aesthetic and attraction, overall, the graphic and visualizations are beautiful and successfully engage the audience, encouraging them to continue reading the story further. I might consider changing the picture in the story title so that the audience could understand at the first glance that this topic is about Thailand’s economy not promoting the tourism industry.
In terms of story flow and logical coherence, most of my interviewees understand the flow and the transition of the story and be able to grasp the key message which is “Despite being a world-renowned tourist destination, Thailand remains trapped in a middle-income country.” However, one of my interviewees suggests that in the transition between solution and call to action, I can make it smooth and clearer by using more actionable words.
My visualizations and pictures are mainly supporting the context. The interviewees like the quality and easy-to-comprehend of the graphs and how they actually provide valuable information. However, to be more specific in detail, I need to revise the coloring, the title and the subtitle as well as the analysis content. Specifically, it needs to be more concise, focusing on middle income and not make the audience confused with the inequality income. In addition, some disclaimers should be added to the related context, for example, the comparative of R&D expenditure between South Korea and Thailand as well as the different weight of GDP calculation in each country.
For the persuasive effectiveness part, I successfully convey the message of who is the target audience. However, I might need to shorten the background information and emphasizes more on the call to action.
I summarize the future changes in the table below:


| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Misunderstand the topic at the first glance| Changing the picture in the story title to be more relevant to the topic. |
| The transition between key problem factors and the solution as well as the ambiguous on call-to-action                                                                                 |Using more actionable words such as “economic reforms” instead of just a “call to action”. In addition, I would like to revise the connection between “Tackle the middle-income trap”, the “Key Factors to Overcome” and the “Call-to-Action” part. I will eliminate the “Improving Infrastructure” part since it’s currently does not support by presented graphs and add more detailed analysis on my focus part i.e. Financing and Upskilled labor.
| Some graphs are not understandable at the first glance.     |Revision of the color, title, and subtitle (explanation) so that audience can just easily understand the story through the visuals without having read the analysis content.                                                                                 |
|  The content is heavy-text and has too much information for the background                                        | Shorten the background information, emphasize more call-to-action, and be more concise in the supporting analysis. Use the bullet point and text styling i.e. bold text to help the audience get the main idea in each paragraph.                                                                                 |
| Misleading in the economic content          |  Revision of the wording used in the analysis to make sure it focuses on the middle-income issue and not leading to inequality in income. In addition, I need to add disclaimers about the economic context of each country when making the comparison.                                    |
